public class YourName {
	public static void main(String[] args) {

		System.out.println("Beastron Carpio");

//data types

/*The first data type we will use is int.

int is short for integer, which are all positive and negative numbers, including zero. This number could represent the number of visits a website has received or the number of programming languages you know.
The int data type only allows values between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647.*/  

public class DataTypes {
	public static void main(String[] args) {

		System.out.println(2468);

	}
}


/*he next data type we will use is the boolean.

A boolean is a data type that can only be either true or false.*/


public class DataTypesB {
	public static void main(String[] args) {

		System.out.println(true);

	}
}


/*The char data type is used to represent single characters. That includes the keys on a keyboard that are used to produce text.

char is short for character and can represent a single character.
All char values must be enclosed in single quotes, like this: 'G'.*/
  
  public class DataTypesC {
	public static void main(String[] args) {

		System.out.println('X');

	}
}


//variables

/*Another important feature of Java (and of many programming languages) is the ability to store values using variables.

A variable stores a value.
In Java, all variables must have a specified data type.
We can assign a variable to a specified data type, like this:

int myLuckyNumber = 7;
The variable myLuckyNumber now stores the value 7 as an int type.

A semicolon ; is also used to end all Java single code statements. We will cover statements that should not end in a semicolon later in this course.
*/
  
public class Variables {
	public static void main(String[] args) {

		int myNumber = 42;
		boolean isFun = true; 
		char movieRating = 'A'; 

	}
}  
  
//whitespace

/*Whitespace is one or more characters (such as a space, tab, enter, or return) that do not produce a visible mark or text. Whitespace is often used to make code visually presentable.

Java will ignore whitespace in code, but it is important to know how to use whitespace to structure code well. If you use whitespace correctly, code will be easier for you and other programmers to read and understand.*/

public class WhiteSpace {
	public static void main(String[] args) {

		boolean isFormatted = false;
    		System.out.println(isFormatted);

	}
} //line 84 - 93, correctly formatted code.

//comments

/*Single line comments are one line comments that begin with two forward slashes:
// I'm a single line comment!
Multi-line comments are generally longer comments that can span multiple lines. They begin with /* and end with */ . Here's an example:
/*

Hello, 
Java! 

*/  */  

public class Comments {
	public static void main(String[] args) {

		//System.out.println("Noise!");
		
/*Dude, I seriously looked this up online about 20 minutes ago. & this is so cutting into my SWTOR time !! :( :( */
