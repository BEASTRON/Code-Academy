#variables

" A variable stores a piece of data, and gives it a specific name.

For example:

spam = 5
The variable spam now stores the number 5."
  
 my_variable = 10 
 
 
 
 #Booleans
 
 "A boolean is like a light switch. It can only have two values. Just like a light switch can only be on or off, a boolean can only be True or False.

You can use variables to store booleans like this:

a = True
b = False"

my_int = 7
my_float = 1.23
my_bool = True



#Reassignments

# my_int is set to 7 below. What do you think
# will happen if we reset it to 3 and print the result?

my_int = 7

# Change the value of my_int to 3 on line 8!

my_int = 3

# Here's some code that will print my_int to the console:
# The print keyword will be covered in detail soon!

print my_int



#Whitespace

"In Python, whitespace is used to structure code. Whitespace is important, so you have to be careful with how you use it."  

def spam():
eggs = 12
return eggs
        
print spam()

"IndentationError: expected an indented block
You'll get this error whenever your whitespace is off.

On Codecademy, we will use two-space indentation (two blank spaces for each indentation) to make sure you can easily read code with multiple indentations in your browser. Beyond Codecademy, you will also see Python code that uses four-space indentation. Both are correct, as long as you make sure to be consistent throughout your code."

#Proper indentation

def spam():
  eggs = 12
  return eggs
        
print spam()
