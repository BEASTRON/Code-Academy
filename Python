#variables

" A variable stores a piece of data, and gives it a specific name.

For example:

spam = 5
The variable spam now stores the number 5."
  
 my_variable = 10 
 
 
 
 #Booleans
 
 "A boolean is like a light switch. It can only have two values. Just like a light switch can only be on or off, a boolean can only be True or False.

You can use variables to store booleans like this:

a = True
b = False"

my_float = 1.23
my_bool = True



#Reassignments

# my_int is set to 7 below. What do you think
# will happen if we reset it to 3 and print the result?

my_int = 7

# Change the value of my_int to 3 on line 8!

my_int = 3

# Here's some code that will print my_int to the console:
# The print keyword will be covered in detail soon!

print my_int
