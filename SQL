--SQL Statements

/*CREATE TABLE is a clause. Clauses perform specific tasks in SQL. By convention, clauses are written in capital letters. Clauses can also be referred to as commands.
table_name refers to the name of the table that the command is applied to.
(column_1 data_type, column_2 data_type, column_3 data_type) is a parameter. A parameter is a list of columns, data types, or values that are passed to a clause as an argument. Here, the parameter is a list of column names and the associated data type.
The structure of SQL statements vary. The number of lines used do not matter. A statement can be written all on one line, or split up across multiple lines if it makes it easier to read. In this course, you will become familiar with the structure of common statements.*/

CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column_1 data_type, 
    column_2 data_type, 
    column_3 data_type
  );

CREATE TABLE celebs(id JEDI BATTLEMASTER ALSO VICE ADMIRAL, --characters only.
name CARPIO, age "22"); --digits must be in quotes.
