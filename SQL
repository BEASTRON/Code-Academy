--SQL Statements

/*CREATE TABLE is a clause. Clauses perform specific tasks in SQL. By convention, clauses are written in capital letters. Clauses can also be referred to as commands.
table_name refers to the name of the table that the command is applied to.
(column_1 data_type, column_2 data_type, column_3 data_type) is a parameter. A parameter is a list of columns, data types, or values that are passed to a clause as an argument. Here, the parameter is a list of column names and the associated data type.
The structure of SQL statements vary. The number of lines used do not matter. A statement can be written all on one line, or split up across multiple lines if it makes it easier to read. In this course, you will become familiar with the structure of common statements.*/

CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column_1 data_type, 
    column_2 data_type, 
    column_3 data_type
  );

CREATE TABLE celebs(id JEDI BATTLEMASTER ALSO VICE ADMIRAL, --characters only.
name CARPIO, age "22"); --digits must be in quotes.



INSERT INTO celebs (id, name, age) VALUES (1, 'Justin Bieber', 21); --INSERT INTO example

SELECT * FROM celebs; -- shows the new row.



--INSERT statements

INSERT INTO celebs (id, name, age)
VALUES (2, 'Twurking', 33);

INSERT INTO celebs (id, name, age)
VALUES (3, 'Trippin', 26);

INSERT INTO celebs (id, name, age)
VALUES (4, 'Gagokapala', 26);

SELECT name FROM celebs; --prints result(s) of INSERT statement(s)




--SELECT statement(s)

/*SELECT statements are used to fetch data from a database. Here, SELECT returns all data in the name column of the celebs table.

1. SELECT is a clause that indicates that the statement is a query. You will use SELECT every time you query data from a database. 
2. name specifies the column to query data from. 
3. FROM celebs specifies the name of the table to query data from. In this statement, data is queried from the celebs table. 

You can also query data from all columns in a table with SELECT.  
* is a special wildcard character that we have been using. It allows you to select every column in a table without having to name each one individually. */
 
 
 --UPDATE statement(s) allow editing of rows.

/*The UPDATE statement edits a row in the table. You can use the UPDATE statement when you want to change existing records.

1. UPDATE is a clause that edits a row in the table. 
2. celebs is the name of the table. 
3. SET is a clause that indicates the column to edit.

age is the name of the column that is going to be updated
22 is the new value that is going to be inserted into the age column.
4. WHERE is a clause that indicates which row(s) to update with the new column value. Here the row with a 1 in the id column is the row that will have the age updated to 22.*/

UPDATE celebs
SET age = 22
WHERE id = 1;

SELECT * FROM celebs; 



/*The ALTER TABLE statement added a new column to the table. You can use this command when you want to add columns to a table.

1. ALTER TABLE is a clause that lets you make the specified changes. 
2. celebs is the name of the table that is being changed. 
3. ADD COLUMN is a clause that lets you add a new column to a table. 

twitter_handle is the name of the new column being added
TEXT is the data type for the new column

4. NULL is a special value in SQL that represents missing or unknown data. Here, the rows that existed before the column was added have NULL values for twitter_handle.*/

ALTER TABLE celebs ADD COLUMN
twitter_handle TEXT;

SELECT * FROM celebs;



--DELETE statement(s)
/*The DELETE FROM statement deletes one or more rows from a table. You can use the statement when you want to delete existing records.

DELETE FROM is a clause that lets you delete rows from a table.
celebs is the name of the table we want to delete rows from.
WHERE is a clause that lets you select which rows you want to delete. Here we want to delete all of the rows where the twitter_handle column IS NULL.
IS NULL is a condition in SQL that returns true when the value is NULL and false otherwise.*/

DELETE FROM celebs WHERE
twitter_handle IS NULL; --deletes all of the rows that have a NULL value in the twitter column.

SELECT * FROM celebs; 


--Queries

--Queries allow us to communicate with the database by asking questions and having the result set return data relevant to the question. 

SELECT name, imdb_rating FROM
movies; --prints name and imbd rating for all movies listed.

SELECT DISTINCT genre FROM movies; --prints genres of movies.
